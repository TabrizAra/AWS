you can't change the que type once created --- FIFO to standard or vice versa not possible 
why Que is required? 
    - Pub   messages consumed by this application sub
    - there should be a system that system is called as que
    - visibility timeout can be set 
    one microservices to another microservice que message sent 
    que name to be given to the developer

    we were having microservice based architecture where one  

Standard:
At-least-once delivery, message ordering isn't preserved
At-least once delivery
Best-effort ordering


FIFO 
First-in-first-out delivery, message ordering is preserved
First-in-first-out delivery
Exactly-once processing


Visibility timeout sets the length of time that a message received from a queue (by one consumer) will not be visible to the other message consumers.

The message retention period is the amount of time that Amazon SQS retains a message that does not get deleted.

If your consumers need additional time to process messages, you can delay each new message coming to the queue.
