Map IP address to Domain name
or domain name to another domain name 


Java -- app running or not --- check with ip:port app upend running --- local way of testing 
ip address cannot be given to outside world 
Get a domain name like www.some.com

purchase domain name ---- with the hep of ROUTE53 --- i will map to the ip to the domain 

map domain nae to another domain namea

Mutiple machines to suffice the load ---- Load balancer at top of the machines ---- load balancer mapped to all the instances
same java application everywhere ---- load balancer will not have an IP address it will have a Alias name/Alias domain name 

.....aws.com ---> alias load balancer domain name 

www.some.com ----- map to backend server ---- map it to load balancer domain name/ alias name 

A type record ---- ip to Domain name, First hit the domain name ---- route 53 sends back the ip A record hostname to ip
the end user send HTTP request to ip server and Gets back the HTTP response 
C name record ----- domain to domain 

In R53 --- we need to create the Registered domain --- 
Once got the domain name ---- go to hosted zone ---- get into the hosted zone ---  create record set ---
here u can map domain name to IP address i.e; A type record 
or I can map a domain name to another domain name c name -- specify the value ---  that's it
Record set ---- 

TTLtime to leave  should be less --- cache,
TTL -- but not low as possible --- high load 
TTL should be moderate where the record set shoul d be updated quite often 


Canonical name 
in value load balancer url given 


ROUTING POLICY 
----- Geolocation routing policy --- it will route the traffic to servers in such a way that the latency is lesss 
-----Weighted routing policy – Use to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify. 
You can use weighted routing to create records in a private hosted zone.
-----Latency routing policy – Use when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to route traffic to the Region that provides the best latency. 
You can use latency routing to create records in a private hosted zone.
-----Failover routing policy – Use when you want to configure active-passive failover. 
You can use failover routing to create records in a private hosted zone.
