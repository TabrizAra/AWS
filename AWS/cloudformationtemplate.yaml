# templates are kept in s3 buckets --- add the templates there 
# each env had their own buckets 
# view in infra composer for diagram view of your code 
# there is an error while creating some resource, so in that case roll back 
# preserve the resources which is created 

#NESTED TEMPLATES 
# Independent of each other 

# if manually hampering the resources manually, it should be done via CF, state file is not updated and it fails 
# how to prevent it , we can do it through drifting, which can be done via Lambda function 
# how to detect the drifiting 

# in json then first write in yaml go to converter and paste it 
# delete the stack to delete all the resources created via it
