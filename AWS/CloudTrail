Cloudtrail, used to monitor user or API activity
IAM users don't have cloutrail access 
    trail can be deleted 

Keeps the record for 3 months only -- cloutrail, 
Event history for 1 year --- create a trail of your own 
it stores the data in s3 bucket --- cloutrail is useing s3

Create a trail based on 
1. Management event - At the service level & resource level what activities are going on, create delete, change disk ec2, create sns, cloud watch etc
2. Data event - Anywhere if your modifying the data wrt database, dynamodb etc data not the service, 
3. Insights event - unusualactivity happens through a/c, where the API failing etc.
